# PDM Group Undecided Indecision

Welcome to the Planning and Decision making repo of Group 30. Here you will find the solution for the final project. Happy reading!

## Running the examples
First, create and activate a python virtual environment by running:
```
python -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/activate
```
> .venv is automatically gitignored in this project. If you want to store the environment in a different folder, you have to add it to the gitignore

Next, install the requirements needed to run this project:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will automatically install all modules needed to run the example files.
These can then be run by:
```
python examples/mobile_reacher_example.py
```
